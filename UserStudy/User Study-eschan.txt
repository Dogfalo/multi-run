User 1: 
Issue: Can jump too high
Analysis: When playing the game, it is possible for the user to jump multiple times 
while swiping up. This is a gameplay bug, and we need to fix it.
Solution: Add a time restriction on jumping if the command has been issued 

Issue: Run off map
Analysis: When playing the game, the level design was incomplete.
Solution: We need to implement better and complete level design with objectives 
and a defined end point.

Issue: Don't die in hole
Analysis: When falling into a hole, the character kept on moving.
Solution: We need to stop character movement if they fall into a hole.

Issue: don't make it float
Analysis: Some of the UI did not scale nicely when the window was resized. 
This could be a potential issue for mobile devices. 
Solution: Test using multiple sizes to ensure that the UI is consistent and usable.
